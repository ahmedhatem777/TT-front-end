# Task-Tracker

### Background:

This project is the front-end for [task-manager-api](https://github.com/ahmedhatem777/task-manager-api), it is a simple bug/task tracker web application where users can sign up, sign in, add, remove, update and view tasks and more.

It was made using [React](https://reactjs.org/), and themes from [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) and [bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/), and it was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), the rest of the packages that helped build this project can be found in the package.json file.
